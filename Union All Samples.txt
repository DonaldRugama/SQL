3. Write a query that JOINs customer and address from the store, and JOINs r_customer and r_address from the restaurant. Then UNION ALL the joined tables.

SELECT
*
FROM customer 
LEFT JOIN address ON address.city_id = customer.city_ID
UNION ALL
SELECT
*
FROM r_customer 
LEFT JOIN r_address ON r_address.city_id = r_customer.city_ID


4. *CHALLENGE* Write a query that JOINs the three tables from both the restaurant and the store. Then, limit the number of columns in each query to customer_id, customer_name, city, and cost. Finally, UNION ALL the results of each together.

SELECT
customer.customer_id, 
customer_name, 
city,
cost
FROM customer
LEFT JOIN transactions ON transactions.customer_id = customer.customer_id
LEFT JOIN address ON address.city_id = customer.city_id
UNION ALL
SELECT
r_customer.customer_id, 
customer_name, 
city,
cost
FROM r_customer
LEFT JOIN r_transactions ON r_transactions.customer_id = r_customer.customer_id
LEFT JOIN r_address ON r_address.city_id = r_customer.city_id
